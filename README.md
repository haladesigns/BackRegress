# BackRegress
BackRegress is investigated and its accuracy is compared to a generic back propagation neural network for an application of classification of the handwritten digits.  The hybrid aims to reduce the amount of iterations during back propagation by utlising logistic regression, while at the same time improving prediction accuracy.
